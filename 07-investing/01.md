# Investing with Ledger

Like any other bookkeeper, Ledger allows you to track your investments.
In the following, an "investment" is any asset that is not in dollars (or your local currency) but convertible to it.
These assets will mainly be stocks but could potentially be anything.
This chapter deals with investments in more detail but the general knowledge on how to deal with other commodities can be applied for other situations.

## Dealing with commodities & market values

Ledger doesn't make a difference between commodities (apples, stocks, ...) and currencies (USD, EUR, ...).
Although it does not matter, it is common practice to put a currency symbol before the amount whereas a commodity symbol will be put behind.
Sample currencies/commodities:

```{.commonlisp}
    $42.00         ; USD (currency)
    â‚¬42.00         ; Euro (currency)
    42 Apple       ; Apples (commodity)
    42 AAPL        ; Shares (commodity)
```

Note that Ledger will pay attention to the format used for any commodity/currency and stick it accordingly.
This is not only true for the symbol's position but also for white spaces or thousand marks ("\$5,000").

In the following, "commodity" and "currency" will be used interchangeably.

To allow Ledger to deal with different commodities, it has to know how to convert them.
This is done by defining one commodity's value in terms of the other.
Two approaches can be used:
Either define the exchange rate in a specific price database (a text file, of course!).
Or specifically mention the rate when adding a journal entry where a commodity needs to be converted.
The latter is quite intuitive:

```ruby
2042/05/01 * Opening Balance
    ; $5,000 in the bank.
    Assets:Checking                   $5,000.00
    Equity:Opening Balances

2042/05/18 * Buying Stock
    ; "Converting" $1500 into 50 AAPL. Exchange rate is $30 per share.
    Assets:Broker                     50 AAPL @ $30.00
    Assets:Checking

2042/05/28 * Selling Stock
    ; Selling 10 shares which have doubled their value.
    Assets:Broker                     -10 AAPL @ $60.00
    Assets:Checking
```

Now, looking at some reports:

```{.bash}
$ led --flat bal Assets
             40 AAPL  Assets:Broker
           $4,100.00  Assets:Checking
--------------------
           $4,100.00
             40 AAPL

$ led reg Assets
42-05-01 Opening Balance        Assets:Checking           $5,000.00    $5,000.00
42-05-18 Buying Stock           Assets:Broker               50 AAPL    $5,000.00
                                                                         50 AAPL
                                Assets:Checking          $-1,500.00    $3,500.00
                                                                         50 AAPL
42-05-28 Selling Stock          Assets:Broker              -10 AAPL    $3,500.00
                                                                         40 AAPL
                                Assets:Checking             $600.00    $4,100.00
                                                                         40 AAPL
```

Forcing Ledger to display everything in a specific currency is achieved using `--exchange` or `-X`:

```{.bash}
$ led --flat -X $ bal Assets
           $2,400.00  Assets:Broker
           $4,100.00  Assets:Checking
--------------------
           $6,500.00

$ led -X $ reg Assets
42-05-01 Opening Balance        Assets:Checking           $5,000.00    $5,000.00
42-05-18 Buying Stock           Assets:Broker             $1,500.00    $6,500.00
                                Assets:Checking          $-1,500.00    $5,000.00
42-05-28 Commodities reval ued  <Revalued>                $1,500.00    $6,500.00
42-05-28 Selling Stock          Assets:Broker              $-600.00    $5,900.00
                                Assets:Checking             $600.00    $6,500.00
```

While defining exchange rates on a per transaction base is handy for the daily work, it does not provide the possibility to reflect current market valuations.
For example, if one bought some shares a year ago, their value has most probably changed.
How could Ledger know?
A simple text file can be used to associate specific dates to exchange rates.
The file's content may look like this:

```{.commonlisp}
    ; On that particular day, 1 bitcoin was worth 4242 Ether.
    P 2042/02/29 10:00:00 BTC 4242 ETH
    ; On that particular day, 1 bitcoin was worth $1337.
    P 2042/02/29 10:00:00 BTC 1337 $
    ; On that particular day, 1 share of AAPL was worth $3.14
    P 2042/02/29 10:00:00 AAPL 3.14 $
```

Having defined such a database, one can get the current market values by:

```{.bash}
ledger --price-db <filename> --market balance
```

Every once in a while, one can append current prices to the database.
This allows the balance report to reflect the "real" values of any asset.

The `led` command defined in `ecosystem/alias` expects the price database to be the file `prices.txt` and always reports current (=latest) market values.

## Reporting gain & loss

Let's have a look again at the last balance report from above:

```{.bash}
$ led -X $ bal Assets
           $2,400.00  Assets:Broker
           $4,100.00  Assets:Checking
--------------------
           $6,500.00
```

Remember that there were $5,000 in the checking account initially.
Buying shares did not change the total amount of assets: $3,500 + 50 AAPL (valued $1,500).
It is only on sell day that this figure changes.
After having sold 10 shares for $60 each, a total of $600 is add to the checking account and removed from the broker account.
And: The remaining 40 shares now value $60 each, too.
Hence, The checking account values $3,500 + $600 = $4,100 while the broker account values (50 - 10) * $60 = \$2,400.

A total gain of \$1,500 was achieved due to the shares doubling in valuation.
This can be seen using `--gain`:

```{.bash}
$ led -X $ --gain bal Assets
$ ledger --gain bal
           $1,500.00  Assets:Broker
$ led --gain reg
42-05-28 Commodities reval ued  <Revalued>                $1,500.00    $1,500.00
```

## Asset Allocation

You may want to know how your money is distributed among different asset classes.
This can be easily achieved by having distinct "allocation" accounts which will serve as placeholders whenever money is put into any asset class.
Using automated transactions & the virtual allocation accounts allow to get an easy overview.
Consider the following:

```{.commonlisp}
account AssetAllocation:P2PLending
account AssetAllocation:Bonds
account AssetAllocation:Stocks

= /Receivables:P2PCompanyX/ or /Assets:P2PCompanyY/
    (AssetAllocation:P2PLending)              1

= expr (commodity == 'AAPL')
    (AssetAllocation:Stocks)                  1

= expr (commodity == 'FundsWithStocksAndBonds')
    (AssetAllocation:Stocks)                0.3
    (AssetAllocation:Bonds)                 0.7

```

(This could be appended to the `meta.txt`.)
Having the above automated transactions setup will keep track of all the investments in the virtual `AssetAllocation` accounts, too.
One can then easily run:

```{.bash}
led bal [--percent] AssetAllocation
```

to get a nice overview of the asset distribution.
The advantage of this approach is that different accounts can be merged into one asset class for example.
Or the other way around: Split up money from one account into different asset classes.
The output will be something like

```{.bash}
$ led bal --percent AssetAllocation
             100.00%  AssetAllocation
              17.10%    Stocks
              43.95%    P2PLending
              13.51%    Bonds
              25.43%    Cash
```
