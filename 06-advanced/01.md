# Advanced {#Advanced}

This chapter introduces some advanced uses of Ledger.

## Formatting

Although the default output of Ledger's report is sufficient in most cases, you sometimes want to change aspects of the output.
Here are a couple of examples to get you started:

```{.bash}
# make big expenses bold
$ led reg --bold-if "amount>100" ^Expenses

# Cut account names
$ led reg --account-width 10

# Assume bigger terminal size
$ led reg -w

# Double the amount of each posting
$ led bal --amount '2*a'

# Invert all amounts
$ led bal --invert
$ led bal --amount '-a'

# Show subtotals as percentage
$ led bal --percent
$ led bal --%
# If you use multiple currencies, you may need to specify --exchange (-X) to calculate percentages
$ led bal --exchange EUR --percent

# Omit the last line in the balance report
$ led bal --no-total
```

The output format of any Ledger report can be customized even more.
In general, there is a format flag for each type of report, say `--balance-format` or `--register-format`.
However, you can always use `--format` (`-F`).
This flag allows you to completely change any aspect of the report.

The default format of the balance report is:

```{.bash}
led bal -F '%(ansify_if(justify(scrub(display_total), 20, 20 + int(prepend_width), true, color), \
    bold if should_bold)) %(!options.flat ? depth_spacer : "") \
    %-(ansify_if(ansify_if(partial_account(options.flat), blue if color), bold if should_bold)) \
    \n%/%$1\n%/%(prepend_width ? " " * int(prepend_width) : "")--------------------\n'
```

This looks a bit scary at first, so let's go over this one by one:

```{.bash}
    %(ansify_if(
      justify(scrub(display_total), 20,
              20 + int(prepend_width), true, color),
                bold if should_bold))
```

The above function roughly says: "Output the total amount (`display_total`), justify it and prepend 20 characters. And make it bold if needed".
This and the latter strings are executed for each posting of the transaction. For the balance report, this means for each account.
The next line tells Ledger to put some whitespace for subcatogorical accounts. (Try out `--flat` to see the difference):

```{.bash}
    %(!options.flat ? depth_spacer : "")
```

What follows is the account name; written in blue and bold if needed:

```{.bash}
    %-(ansify_if(
       ansify_if(partial_account(options.flat), blue if color),
                 bold if should_bold))\n
```

The remaining part is special. The sequence '%/' separates the format string into stuff which should be printed for the first posting of each transactions and what should be printed for all postings. In the balance report, there is only "one" transaction. '\$1' refers to the first element of the previous lines, in this case the total amount:

```{.bash}
    %/%$1\n
    %/%(prepend_width ? " " * int(prepend_width) : "") --------------------\n")
```

Using the above pieces, you could create your own report format.
As an example, the `ecosystem/alias` defines the function `ledbalper` which make use of this feature:
The defined report format resembles the usual balance format but adds a percentage column.
Try out `ledbalper Expenses` in the private repo to get an impression of how that looks like.
Often, you will want to have the output sorted by total.
This is achieved with `ledbalper --sort "T" Expenses:Transportation` or `ledbalper --sort "T" --flat Expenses:Transportation Expenses:MobileCommunication` (use `--flat` when combining subcategories on the same hierarchy level).

## Virtual postings

A virtual posting is not a real posting (sic!).
Hence, virtual postings do not count when balancing out the transaction's postings to zero.
A normal transaction ...

```{.scheme}
2042/01/25 * Pizza
    Expenses:Holidays             $20.00
    Assets:Cash
```

... becomes:

```{.bash}
$ ledger bal
             $-20.00  Assets:Cash
              $20.00  Expenses:Holidays
--------------------
                   0
```

Whereas a transaction with virtual postings doesn't need to balance to zero:

```{.scheme}
2042/01/25 * Pizza
    ; Spent the money during holidays. But actually for food.
    Expenses:Holidays            $20.00
    Assets:Cash
    (Expenses:Food)              $20.00
```

Balance:

```{.bash}
$ ledger bal
             $-20.00  Assets:Cash
              $40.00  Expenses
              $20.00    Food
              $20.00    Holidays
--------------------
             $40.00
```

Or:

```{.bash}
$ ledger bal --real
             $-20.00  Assets:Cash
              $20.00  Expenses:Holidays
--------------------
                   0
```

That is, any virtual posting may be omitted by providing the `--real` argument:

```{.bash}
$ ledger bal Food
             $-20.00  Expenses:Food

$ ledger bal Food --real
# empty
```

You may use brackets (they look "more strict") instead of parentheses to force virtual postings to balance out:

```{.scheme}
2042/01/25 * Pizza
    Expenses:Holidays            $20.00
    Assets:Cash
    [Expenses:Food]             $-20.00
    [Equity:Food]                $20.00
```

You'll ask what's the big deal about this?
Well, virtual postings are very handy in combination with automated transactions ...

## Automated Transactions {#Automated_Transactions}

An automated transaction is like a normal transaction except that it's header line does not contain the date but rather specifies under which circumstances the automated transaction should amend its postings to another transaction.
Automated transaction need to be specified before any transaction they should apply to.
An automated transaction is introduced with a "=".
The posting's amount may either be a total amount (in a commodity) or a percentage value.

Examples:

```{.scheme}
; Whenever the posting's account matches 'food', add 100% of the value
; to it's corresponding account in the budget.
= food
    (Budget:$account)                 1

2042/01/25 * Pizza
    Expenses:Food                $20.00
    Assets:Cash
```

When running through Ledger, the above entry becomes:

```{.scheme}
    2042/01/25 * Pizza
        Expenses:Food                $20.00
        (Budget:Expenses:Food)       $20.00
        Assets:Cash                 $-20.00
```

Or:

```{.scheme}
; When encountering Income:Sales, add 19% of the posting's
; value to Liabilities:Taxes.
= /^Income:Sales$/
    (Liabiliites:Taxes)             0.19

2042/01/25 * Gotchas
    ; sold 43 gotchas the other day
    Income:Sales         (43 * -$39.99)
    Equity
```

Becomes:

```{.bash}
$ ledger reg
42-01-25 Gotchas                Income:Sales              $-1719.57    $-1719.57
                                Equity                     $1719.57            0
                                (Liabilites:Taxes)         $-326.72     $-326.72
```

The following example (get [Gist](https://gist.github.com/rolfschr/46ae069d15c062e2d5c0) online) refers to the automated transaction employed during the [journal update](#Get_data_from_Northbank):

```{.scheme}
; I live together with a flatmate. He transfers me money every month to cover
; for the rent & utilities. I pay the bills for all flatmates. Hence, the total
; amount of money I transfer to say the electricity company is not what I spend
; myself on electricity. The automated transactions below splits up the money I
; receive from my flatmate into the different accounts and reduce the money I
; actually pay.

= expr account =~ /Expenses:Utilities:Phone/
    ; Make it look like paying $15 less when paying for the phone bill
    ; and expect that amount from the flatmates.
    Expenses:Utilities:Phone                $-15
    Receivables:Flatmates                   $15
= expr account =~ /Expenses:Utilities:Electricity/
    ; Make it look like paying 50% less.
    Expenses:Utilities:Electricity          -0.5
    Receivables:Flatmates                   0.5
= expr account =~ /Expenses:Rent/ and payee =~ /Scrooge/
    ; Only deduct when paying money to that specific landlord.
    ; Use '$account' as a placeholder to not repeat the account's name.
    $account                                $-150
    Receivables:Flatmates                   $150

; Here come the real transactions ...

2042/01/15 * John Doe
    ; Here I received the money from my flatmate.
    Receivables:Flatmates                $-205
    Assets:Checking

2042/01/23 * Mr. Scrooge
    ; Paying the rent to the landlord.
    Expenses:Rent                         $300
    Assets:Checking

2042/01/25 * TalkTalkTalk Inc.
    ; Paying the phone bill.
    Expenses:Utilities:Phone               $30
    Assets:Checking

2042/01/31 * HamsterWheel Ltd.
    ; Paying for electricity.
    Expenses:Utilities:Electricity         $80
    Assets:Checking
```

From the recorded transactions above, we would expect to pay $300 + $30 + $80 = $410 to the various parties.
However, due to the automated transaction, the money received from the flatmate is used to reduce this amount by 50%:

```{.bash}
$ ledger -f sample.txt bal ^Expenses
                $205  Expenses
                $150    Rent
                 $55    Utilities
                 $40      Electricity
                 $15      Phone
--------------------
                $205

$ ledger -f sample.txt reg ^Expenses
42-01-23 Mr. Scrooge            Expenses:Rent                  $300         $300
                                Expenses:Rent                 $-150         $150
42-01-25 TalkTalkTalk Inc.      Expens:Utilities:Phone          $30         $180
                                Expens:Utilities:Phone         $-15         $165
42-01-31 HamsterWheel Ltd.      Ex:Utiliti:Electricity          $80         $245
                                Ex:Utiliti:Electricity         $-40         $205
```

Grab the sample journal [here](https://gist.github.com/rolfschr/46ae069d15c062e2d5c0).
You may use `--actual` to ignore the automated transactions.
On the other hand, `--generated` will explicitly include auto-generated postings in the resulting journal.
Go give both command line switches a try.
(By the way: `--generated` is used in `ecosystem/convert.py`.)

Here's another automated transaction example: I have a liability insurance and a household insurance both provided by the same insurance company.
Whenever they withdraw money from my bank account, I want that money to be split up among the different insurance accounts.

```{.scheme}
; Note: An automated transaction applies to all matching postings.
; Matching by payee would apply the auto. trans. to all postings of a
; transaction. But we only want to apply it once. Hence, we will take
; the posting with the positive amount.
= expr payee =~ /Insurance Company X/ and amount > 0
    Expenses:Insurance:Liability         $5.31
    Expenses:Insurance:Household         $3.87
    Expenses:Unknown                    $-9.18
```

Given the above, the following transaction:

```{.scheme}
2042/04/01 * Insurance Company X
    Expenses:Unknown                     $9.18
    Assets:Checking                     $-9.18
```

Becomes:

```{.scheme}
2042/04/01 * Insurance Company X
    Expenses:Unknown                     $9.18
    Assets:Checking                     $-9.18
    Expenses:Insurance:Liability         $5.31
    Expenses:Insurance:Household         $3.87
    Expenses:Unknown                    $-9.18
```

Another good use for automated transactions is grouping of accounts.
As an example, all fixed cost that have to be paid every month can be linked together like so:

```{.scheme}
account FixedCost

= /Rent$/ or /Electricity$/ or /Insurance$/ or /Telephone$/
    (FixedCost)                              1
```

The above statement allows to query for (any change in) the fixed cost with `led reg FixedCost`.
You'll have to add the appropriate accounts, of course.

## Resetting a balance

It may be possible that one of your Ledger account does not match it's value in real life.
In this situation, Ledger allows you to set the account's value to a specific amount.
This is achieved by using the "=" operator in front of the posting's amount.

```{.bash}
2042/04/01 Adjusting Checking account
   Assets:Checking                  = $1190.63
   Equity:Adjustments
```
